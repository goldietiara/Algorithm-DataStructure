My goal is to had a solid understanding of the fundamental of algorithms ( •̀ᴗ•́ )و 
by taking a practical take on algorithms with JS ( •̀ᴗ•́ )و
not going to go in depth on the theoretical aspects of algorithms ( ≖ ͜ʖ≖)

ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ ALGORITHMS ✧
is a set of well-defined instructor to solve a particular problem
algorithms had well defined inputs and outputs, each step should be clear and unambiguous
algorithms is language independent you can use algorithms in other language, its just a sequence of instructor

we had many ways to resolve one problem, each way comes with its own tradeoff when it comes to performance and efficiency



ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY ✧

The absolute running time of an algorithms cannot be predicted, since of these factors:
✧ The programming language that being used
✧ The computer that running the program
✧ Other program running at the same time
✧ Quality of the Operating System (OS)

The performance of the algorithm is affected by the size of its input
✧ Time Complexity = Amount of TIME taken by an algorithm to run
✧ Space Complexity = Amount of MEMORY taken by an algorithm to run

To represent complexity we can use Asymptotic Notations
✧ Asymptotic Notations is Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity
  There are mainly 3 Asymptotic Notation:
    1. Big-O Notation (O-notation) for Worst case complexity
    2. Omega Notation (Ω-notation) for Best case complexity
    3. Theta Notation (Θ-notation) for Average case complexity

To make it more practical and easy to understand we'll be using the worst case complexity, because we will be more concern about the worst case complexity



ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ BIG O NOTATION ✧
the worst case complexity is represented using the Big-O notation
Big-O describe the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms

Big-O characteristic:
✧ it is expressed in terms of the input
✧ it focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details

Time Complexity
✧ O(n) is linear time complexity, because it will execute depends on the input
    ex:
    function summation(n){
        let sum = 0
        for (let i = 1; i<=n; i++){
            sum +=i
        }
        return sum
    }

✧ O(1) is constant time complexity, because it execute only once
    ex:
    function summation(n){
        return (n * (n + 1)) / 2
    }

✧ O(nˆ2) is quadratic time complexity, for two nested loop
    ex:
    for(i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        for(j = 1; j <= i; j++){
            //code
        }
    }

    3nˆ2 + 5n + 1

✧ O(nˆ3) is cubic time complexity, for three nested loop

✧ O(logn) is logarithmic time complexity, for input size reduces by half every iteration
